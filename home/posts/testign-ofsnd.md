Indian MSE's are still stuck working with the old habits and ways , very few have adapted to the recent technology boom and make it work for them properly. 

But boss ! What are MSE's  - 

> Enterprises engaged in the manufacture or production, processing or preservation of goods as specified below:
>
> A micro enterprise is an enterprise where investment in plant and machinery does not exceed Rs. 25 lakh;
>
> A small enterprise is an enterprise where the investment in plant and machinery is more than Rs. 25 lakh but does not exceed Rs. 5 crore;
>
> A medium enterprise is an enterprise where the investment in plant and machinery is more than Rs.5 crore but does not exceed Rs.10 crore.

These enterprises form the majority of businesses in Indian , mostly family owned which have not been able to make the tech work for them. 
Apart from the usual boom in B2B websites such as Indiamart , Alibaba and a few business listings sites.  Most of these MSE's have not registered elsewhere , and are no where near making the use of the tech to it's fullest potential.

Overall there are 3 major verticals where we can use technology for growth - 

1. Awareness
2. Sales Channels
3. Operations
