title: Oi! 
date: 1 Feb 2018

This past week has found me working on an old abandoned idea , a static-site generator built using flask with Digital Ocean and Github integration.
> Cause Pythonistas hate ruby (aka Jekyll)

This website has been built using flake the same ol' idea I was talking about.
If interested take a peep [here](https://github.com/PadamSethia/Hafta). It is still under development.

Bye!
